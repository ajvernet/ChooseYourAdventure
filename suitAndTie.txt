Today is a snazzy kinda day”, you think to yourself.  You take out your nice Italian suit, and your nicest cufflinks.  A clean shave, some cologne.  You look like a million bucks.

You show up to work, and people are staring.  Except it’s not the good kind of stare.  People start laughing in your direction, and not with you… All of a sudden it dawns on you that today is casual Friday.  

You get fired.

You wake up, heart racing.  Phew!  It was just a  bad dream.
