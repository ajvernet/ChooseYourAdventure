You go over the powerpoint presentation you prepared for today’s executive meeting.  
You flip open your laptop, go to the right folder, open up the file and … what the heck… your presenation is gone.  
Instead, there are just pictures of Harry, your roommate, picking his nose.  
“I hate you Harry”, you say to yourself, “I really frickin hate you”.  You lose your job.
