You start up your pokemon go app on your mobile device.  
You see that there is a rare pokemon about a mile down the road.  You walk on, aimlessly, for nearly 15 minutes. 
 You hear sounds behind you.  You don’t care, you are getting your damn pokemon if it’s the last thing you do. 
You catch the pokemon!  You turn around.  There is a live pokemon standing in front of you.  It eats you.  You are dead.
