You rev up your car and drive.  You are looking for a new gym.  You drive and drive, keeping your eyes 
fixed firmly on your pokemon app.  You hear distant screaming and crashing in the background, but you push onwards, 
oblivious . You finally find a new pokemon gym.  You get out of the car, still deaf to the horrible, 
wretched sounds of suffering behind you.  You end up playing pokemon for a while, then head to work.
